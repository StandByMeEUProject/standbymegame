            <h2>
                Welcome to the Stand by Me world: an oddly shaped planet with
                imperceptible borders where every resident, at the age of 16
                years old, leave his/her homes and families to face
                extraordinary adventures and challenges with their superpowers.
            </h2>
            <p>
                This scenario applies daily to boys and girls leaving the
                alternative care system and that are asked to face and cope with
                the challenges of autonomy earlier than their peers. This free
                and downloadable game is an awareness and critical thinking tool
                about autonomy and growing up, built through a participative
                process thanks to the Stand by Me European project. The game
                applies to boys and girls but also to the adults going along
                with them.
